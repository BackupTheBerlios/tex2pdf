<h1> Tex2pdf/Lyx2pdf Homepage </h1>
The major goal of the tex2pdf script is to help people who do not know a lot
about LaTeX or PDF generation (like me :-) to obtain a useable PDF document
without spending a lot of time on this issue.<br>
Additionally, it might be even a useful tool for someone who knows about all
these tricks, tools and everything, but wants to have it quick!<br>
Anyway, I hope people can make use of it.
<h2>Description</h2>
tex2pdf (formerly lyx2pdf) is a script that generates a PDF document from a
LaTeX or LyX document using pdf(la)tex, hyperref and other tools. There is a
bash shell and Perl implementation available.<br>
The bash port (tex2pdf 2.x) is no longer maintained and is considered
deprecated. However, you can still find it in the
<a href="http://download.berlios.de/tex2pdf/">download area of released versions</a>. 
tex2pdf is coded in Perl from version 3.0 on.<br>
<br>
When the input file is a LyX document the script produces a LaTeX file with the
LyX export function first and than processes the exported LaTeX document.<br>
LaTeX documents are searched for referenced files (other LaTeX docs, images),
prepared for pdflatex, included EPS/PS/PSTEX images are converted to PDF with 
epstopdf and finally the script runs pdflatex, bibtex, makeindex, thumbpdf or 
authorindex depending on the dependencies encountered. The entire behavior can
be adjusted to your personal needs and workarounds for
known problems with called applications are already integrated.<br>

<h2>Primary dependencies</h2>
<ul>
   <li><a href="http://tug.org/applications/pdftex">pdftex</a>: generates PDF
   documents from LaTeX. Unfortunately, it cannot handle EPS graphics. This
   missing feature is the main reason why the tex2pdf project has started ...
   <li><a href="http://tug.org/applications/pdftex">epstopdf</a>: translates
   EPS images in PDF ones.
   <li><a href="http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref">hyperref</a>: LaTeX
   package to integrate (colored) links in your PDF doc. It's great!
   <li><a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/sed">sed</a>: All sed expressions
   have been replaced by Perl now and it is only needed for the old bash port.
</ul>

<h2>Other dependencies</h2> Depending on the selected options tex2pdf supports the 
following tools:
<ul>
   <li>bibtex: handles a bibliograhy and its references.
   <li><a href="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/glosstex.html">glosstex</a>:
   handles a glossary using bibtex
   <li><a href="">makeindex</a>: creates an index from your LaTeX document.
   <li><a href="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/authorindex.html">authorindex</a>:
   creates an author index based on the citations made along the document
   <li><a href="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/thumbpdf.html">thumbpdf</a>:
   creates little images of all your document pages and integrate them.
   <li><a href="http://www-sp.iti.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/software/ppower4/beta/">
   ppower4</a>: A java class to postprocess PDF files adding pause effects
   not only in the text but also in the image displaying.
   <li><a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a>: A LaTeX word processor. It is
   only required when you want to process Lyx documents.
</ul>

<h2>Handled graphic formats</h2> Currently tex2pdf cvs version is able to handle automatically the following graphic formats
<ul>
   <li> eps/ps: tex2pdf convert eps or ps files to pdf file using eps2pdf
   <li> eps.gz/ ps.gz:
   <li> pstex: tex2pdf convert combined ps/latex files to pdf files
   <li> metapost files can be included using includegraphics or \convertMPtoPDF and tex2pdf takes them into account.
   In fact the metapost files are managed by pdflatex. xfig 3.2 patchlevel 3d or newer exports metapost files
   <li> multimetapost files: when the resulting pdf file is postprocessed by ppower this format allows the incremental
   presentation of graphic information. xfig 3.2 patchlevel 3d or newer exports multimetapost files
</ul>
