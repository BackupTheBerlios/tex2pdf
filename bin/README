tex2pdf replaces lyx2pdf. lyx2pdf is deprecated and should not be used anymore.

Install Instructions:

  1. To install tex2pdf pack it out with 'tar xfz FILE' and move the resulting
     tex2pdf file in a bin directory that is in your path. 
  2. Make sure that the script has the right path to your bash shell!
     It should be found at /bin/bash. If it is somewhere else on your system
     modify the first line in tex2pdf accordingly. 
  3. Then you might want to adjust the default parameters for all users in
     tex2pdf itself with an editior. 
  4. Each user of the script has to run 'tex2pdf -r' first in order to customize
     it. The given settings will be stored in a private RC file in the user's
     home directory. 
  5. Finally, run 'tex2pdf -h' to see a tiny help info for the command line
     options.
